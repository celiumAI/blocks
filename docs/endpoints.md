# endpoints

endpoints for me are just locations that you can check out using your browser

but it goes deeper than that.

but still i will bodge it together and just use endpoints which expect and return nothing but plain text. thats it

the documentation for each endpoint can be found in `/docs/endpoints/`
 
each [block](./block.md) must have:

- a [root](./endpoints/get/root.md) route at `/`
- a [home](./endpoints/home.md) route at `/home`
- a [heartbeat](./endpoints/heartbeat.md) route at `/heartbeat`
